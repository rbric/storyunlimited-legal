# Privacy Policy

**StoryUnlimited**
*Last updated: February 11, 2026*

## Overview

StoryUnlimited is designed with privacy at its core. The app runs entirely on your device and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No usage analytics or telemetry
- No crash reporting sent to external services
- No advertising or ad tracking
- No cookies or web tracking
- No third-party SDKs that collect data

## Data Storage

All data created within StoryUnlimited is stored **locally on your device only**:

- **Child profiles** (name, age, avatar) — stored in on-device app storage
- **Companions and story worlds** — stored in on-device app storage
- **Generated stories** — stored as a local file on your device
- **AI model files** — downloaded once from HuggingFace and stored on your device

No data is synced to any cloud service. No data is backed up to our servers. We have no servers.

## AI Processing

Story generation is performed **entirely on your device** using a locally downloaded AI model. Your prompts, stories, and child information are never sent to any server or API. The AI engine runs offline after the initial model download.

## Network Usage

StoryUnlimited connects to the internet **only** to download AI model files from HuggingFace (huggingface.co) when you choose to download a Magic Engine. After the download is complete, the app functions fully offline.

No other network connections are made. Ever.

## Children's Privacy

StoryUnlimited does not collect any information from children or adults. All child profile data (name, age, avatar) is entered by the parent and stored only on the local device. This data is never transmitted anywhere.

## Third-Party Services

StoryUnlimited does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only external service used is HuggingFace for the one-time download of AI model files.

## Data Deletion

All app data is stored locally on your device. To delete all data:

- Delete individual stories, child profiles, companions, or worlds from within the app
- Or simply delete the StoryUnlimited app — all data is removed automatically

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, we will post the revised version here with an updated date. Since we collect no data, material changes are unlikely.
