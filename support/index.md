## Quick Help

### 1) The app says I need a Magic Engine

1. Open **Magic Library**.
2. Download one engine.
3. Set it as **Active**.
4. Return to Stories.

Tip: the first download can take a few minutes depending on your connection and device.

### 2) Story generation is stuck or very slow

- Make sure an engine is active.
- Keep the app open during generation.
- Try a smaller/faster engine first.
- Restart the app if generation appears frozen.

### 3) I can't create a story

To generate a story, you must select:

- a child profile
- a companion
- a world

Optional: add special wishes.

### 4) I changed engine but quality/speed didn't change

After switching engines, wait a few seconds for initialization, then try generating a new story.

### 5) Can I edit stories?

Yes. Open a story and use the edit option to adjust wording, grammar, or length.

### 6) Can I use the app offline?

Yes. After engine download is complete, story generation works fully on-device and offline.
